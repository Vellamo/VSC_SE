# Space Engineer Scripting 

The following repository is a container of various (Space-Engineer specific) C# scripts.

## Getting Started

These instructions will allow you to try some of my scripts for yourself! They are not available on the Steam Workshop.

### Prerequisites

The things you need:

```
* A copy of Space Engineers
```

### Installation

You will first need to spawn the Programmable Block and copy & paste the desired script (.cs) from the Space Engineers folder.

```
You may encounter an error if Scripting is not enabled in the world, amend world setting as neccesary.

Choose "Edit" on the programmable block, insert the copied code. 

The code should compile, if not choose "Recompile"
```

## Usage

A few examples of useful commands and/or tasks.


```
# First example
# Second example
# And keep this in mind
```

My scripting could not have been completed without the exhaustive use of Malware's Development Kit for SE: https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE
